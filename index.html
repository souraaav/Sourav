          <h2>About Me</h2>
<h3> A Professional Introduction of Myself ‚Äì Sourav Chowdhury </h3>
          <p>"Code is not just syntax; it's a vision waiting to be brought to life."</p>
<p>Greetings! My name is Sourav Chowdhury, a Class 11 student with a passionate drive for learning, building, and innovating. I believe that the future belongs to those who dare to dream beyond what is visible, and who use technology as a canvas to paint those dreams into reality.</p>

<p>As a teenager growing up in the digital era, I have always been fascinated not just by using apps and websites but by understanding how they work. This curiosity led me into the exciting world of programming, where logic meets creativity, and where even a single line of code has the potential to change the way we interact with the world.

In this self-introduction, I would like to present not only who I am, but also what I seek to become. I will share my background, technical interests, creative projects, and long-term goals that define my vision‚Äînot just as a student, but as an innovator and future contributor to the ever-evolving field of technology.</p>
<h4>My Skills and What I‚Äôve Built</h4>
<p> <ul>
  <li><strong>HTML/CSS/JavaScript:</strong> I design modern, animated, mobile-friendly web pages. I enjoy experimenting with layouts, dark/light themes, smooth transitions, and custom designs.</li>
  <li><strong>Python:</strong> My go-to language for writing logic-based tools, scientific calculators, and AI-based prototypes. I‚Äôve used it for basic machine learning, automation, and games.</li>
  <li><strong>Java (ISC format):</strong> I strictly follow the ICSE/ISC structure and create clean, understandable code that meets syllabus standards, such as for Fibonacci series, prime checks, and pattern programs.</li>
  <li><strong>C Programming:</strong> I have basic knowledge of how C works at the system level and how it powers game development, operating systems, and compilers.</li>
  <li><strong>Design:</strong> I have an eye for design, color schemes, and typography, and I strive to make my interfaces both aesthetic and functional.</li>
</ul></p>
        </div>
      <p>If there‚Äôs one thing I believe deeply in, it‚Äôs that age should never limit ambition. I may be in Class 11 today, but I dream and work like someone building for tomorrow.

You don‚Äôt need to be in Silicon Valley to make an impact. You don‚Äôt need millions of followers. All you need is an idea, the courage to pursue it, and the humility to keep learning. And that‚Äôs what I bring to the table.


Let‚Äôs Connect, Build, and Create a Better Digital Future

Whether you‚Äôre a student, mentor, developer, designer, or investor‚Äîif you believe in the power of ideas, I‚Äôd love to connect. I‚Äôm open to collaboration, mentorship, feedback, and new challenges.

I am Sourav Chowdhury‚Äîa student, a coder, a dreamer‚Äîand I‚Äôm just getting started.
